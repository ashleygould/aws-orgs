in logger: prepend timestamp to messages
add README file, document spec-file structure
add unit testing
make logger write to different url
control order of organization tasks
create setup.py and package module
scan_deployed_accounts: fix 'NextToken' logic.



DONE get rid of globals
DONE account creation
DONE make spec-file input and report output similar
DONE create documentation (pydoc)
DONE validate/sanitize org_spec input
DONE get rid of var change_counter
DONE send messages to a text accumutator or ??  
DONE in aws-orgs.manage_accounts:
  DONE test account creation status running move_account()
DONE in specify_policy_content: test keys exist
DONE in manage_policy_attachments raise error when:
    DONE detaching default policy
    DONE attaching to an absent ou
DONE in manage_policies: dont delete a policy attached to an ou
DONE in scan_deployed_accounts:
  DONE crosscheck fully created accounts against States=['SUCCEEDED'])['CreateAccountStatuses']





CONSIDER:
NO divide into sub modules.  how would that look?
NO should account spec be separate file?
parse account names for compliance
account-spec details allowed values for name components

## Example: using exceptions:

def get_root_id(org_client):
    """
    Query deployed AWS Organization for its Root ID.
    """
    try:
        root_id = org_client.list_roots()['Roots'][0]['Id']
        return root_id
    except NoCredentialsError as e:
        print sys.argv[0]
        print e
        print "at function:", inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())[2]
        print "in module:", __name__
        raise SystemExit
    except ClientError as e:
        print e
        print "at function:", inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())[2]
