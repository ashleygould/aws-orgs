DONE create users
DONE create groups
DONE populate users in groups
validate all path assignments against org 'teams' data spec.
create custom policies

create credentials for new users
email credentials new users

ISSUES:
how/where do we structure/deploy yaml data for teams specification?
  maybe place it in a db or ldap or redis?
  currently this resides in the spec-file used by accounts.py.
