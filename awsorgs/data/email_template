Dear User,

You have been granted access to our central AWS authentication account.
From here you can assume designated roles into other AWS accounts in
our Organization.

Please use the credentials below to log into the AWS console and
complete your own user setup.  You will be required to change your
password as you log in.

Note: the one time password with expire after 24 hours if not reset.

  IAM User Name:	$user_name
  One Time Password:	$onetimepw
  Login URL:            https://${trusted_account}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


Once logged in take the time to set up a 'Virtual MFA Device' and 'AWS
Access Keys' for your IAM user.  We recommend you install 'Google
Authenticator' app on your cell to use as your 'Virtual MFA Device'.

After your MFA is set up, log out and log back in again.  You will be
queried for your 6 digit token code.  Now you can assume role into any
accounts where you have cross account access.

Your IAM user has been granted cross account access to the following:
