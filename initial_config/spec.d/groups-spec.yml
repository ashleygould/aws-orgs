# List of IAM group resources managed within the Auth account.  Each 
# group has 5 possible attributes:
#  Name:            Type 'str'.   The group name (required).
#  Ensure:          Type 'str'.   One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'.
#                   Setting to 'absent' will cause the group to be deleted but
#                   only if the group contains no users.
#  Members:         Type 'list' or keyword 'ALL'.  List of IAM users who are
#                   members of this group.  If set to 'ALL', all managed users
#                   in the Auth account become members.
#  ExcludeMembers:  Type 'list'.  If 'Members' attribute is set to 'ALL', any
#                   users listed in 'ExludeMembers' are excluded from the group.
#  Policies:        Type 'list'.  List of IAM policies to attach to this group.
