# Organizational Unit Specification.  This maps the Organization's
# structure and assigns policies and accounts to organizational units.
# Each Organizational Unit (OU) has 5 possible attributes:
#   Name:         Type 'str'.   The name of the OU (required)
#   Ensure:       Type 'str'.   One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'.
#                 Setting to 'absent' will cause the OU to be deleted but
#                 only if no accounts are still assigned to the OU.
#   Accounts:     Type 'list'.  List of account names assigned to this OU.
#   Policies:     Type 'list'.  List of Service Control Policies attached to
#                 this OU.
#   Child_OU:     Type 'list'.  List of child Organizational Units.
